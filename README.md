# ChromaEmbeddingsDB Plugin

## Overview

The `ChromaEmbeddingsDB` plugin integrates with the [ChromaDB](https://www.trychroma.com/) database to provide a robust solution for managing and querying embeddings. This plugin extends the abstract `EmbeddingsDB` class, allowing you to store, retrieve, and query embeddings efficiently using ChromaDBâ€™s capabilities.

This plugin is meant to be used by other specialized plugins such as:
- https://github.com/TigreGotico/ovos-face-embeddings-plugin
- https://github.com/TigreGotico/ovos-voice-embeddings-plugin
- https://github.com/TigreGotico/ovos-gguf-embeddings-plugin

## Features

- **Add Embeddings**: Store embeddings with associated keys.
- **Retrieve Embeddings**: Fetch embeddings by their keys.
- **Delete Embeddings**: Remove embeddings by their keys.
- **Query Embeddings**: Find the closest embeddings to a given query, with support for cosine distance.

## Example

Here is a full example demonstrating the basic usage of `ChromaEmbeddingsDB`.

```python
import numpy as np
from chroma_embeddings_db import ChromaEmbeddingsDB

# Initialize the database
db = ChromaEmbeddingsDB(path="path_to_chromadb_storage")

# Add embeddings
embedding1 = np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3])
embedding2 = np.array([0.4, 0.5, 0.6])
db.add_embeddings("user1", embedding1)
db.add_embeddings("user2", embedding2)

# Retrieve and print embeddings
print(db.get_embedding("user1"))
print(db.get_embedding("user2"))

# Query embeddings
query_embedding = np.array([0.2, 0.3, 0.4])
results = db.query(query_embedding, top_k=2)
print(results)

# Delete an embedding
db.delete_embedding("user1")
```

> Ensure that the path provided to the `ChromaEmbeddingsDB` constructor is accessible and writable.
